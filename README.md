# Ebay Webscraper

> Welcome to my **Ebay Ruby Web scraper** built mainly with `Ruby` and `Nokogiri`, but also using `Rspec`, `Simplecov` for testing and the `spreadsheets` for exporting to an excel file. Please enjoy and leave a comment.

The basic idea of the project is to collect data from www.ebay.com, based on the user's suggested keywords, and perform a basic statistical analysis (min, max, standard deviation, quartile 1, quartile 3, median, mean, and a histogram).
After the analysis is finished and its results showed on the screen, the user is prompted to 'export' the data (in .xls format), if he/she wishes to do so, for further processing in some other statistical software.
